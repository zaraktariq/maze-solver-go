#### The code for the struct in Go:
```go
type Point struct {
    x int
    y int
}
```
#### Is equivalent to this code in Python:
```python
class Point:
def __init__(self, x, y):
    self.x = x
    self.y = y
```
------
- := is used for short variable declaration and initialization.
- = is used for variable assignment.

#### This is how one prints in Go
```go
fmt.Print(cell, " ")
```

#### In comparison to our familiar python
```go
print(cell, end=" ")
```
